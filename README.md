# Codex

This repository contains a basic React application created with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/).

The React project resides in the `app` directory. To run it locally:

```bash
cd app
npm install
npm run dev
```

This will start the development server with hot module reloading.

## GitHub Pages

The project is configured to deploy automatically to GitHub Pages using the
workflow in `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`. After pushing to the `main` branch
on GitHub, the site will be available at:

```
https://<your-github-username>.github.io/Codex/
```

Replace `<your-github-username>` with your actual GitHub username.
